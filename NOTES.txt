long press from tools set somestimes goes directly to game menu

ability to scroll off a display (and scroll on, like inserting 12 spaces before or after)
also scroll in the other direction (for short strings)

mad libs

time game choose a color and the average is stored with it, allowing for three profiles

have segments disappear randomly or go into place randomly

keep timer running in the background
	save and restore a timer basis when it's started

if title show times < 3 doesn't show it

last frame of scroll animation seems to skip ahead 1

tests - button closure time while pressed, glitchyness etc., timing of millis

setting for clock speed
it's losing about 2 seconds a day, might be able to tweak the daily clock basis

the clock should look different in idle mode so you know it's ok not to use a long press (or in idle mode long press to exit)

add lm34
option to show temp instead of seconds for clock
option for c or f

options for timeout time
[ ] prompt timeouts
[x]] idle timeouts
