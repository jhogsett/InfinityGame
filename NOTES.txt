time game choose a color and the average is stored with it, allowing for three profiles

// have segments disappear randomly or go into place randomly

// keep timer running in the background
	// save and restore a timer basis when it's started

// if title show times < 3 doesn't show it

// last frame of scroll animation seems to skip ahead 1

// tests - button closure time while pressed, glitchyness etc., timing of millis

// setting for clock speed
// it's losing about 2 seconds a day, might be able to tweak the daily clock basis

// the clock should look different in idle mode so you know it's ok not to use a long press (or in idle mode long press to exit)

// add lm34
// option to show temp instead of seconds for clock
// option for c or f

options for timeout time
- prompt timeouts
