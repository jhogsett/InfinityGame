The "Infinity Game" it is the beginning of an infinity of possible Arduino-based games. With a colorful alphanumeric display, arcade-style buttons, bright LEDs, sound and a vibrator, any number of fun games are possible based on the Arduino architecture.

The idea started as “The Reaction Time Game”. It was meant to be a digital version of the in-person game where one person holds a dollar bill vertically, and challenges another person to keep the bill if they can catch it when suddenly dropped. The game would provide a stimulus - a light, sound, vibration, word etc. - and then you would press a button as fast as you could, only after the stimulus occurred.

I soon realized the same device could be used for lots of kinds of games. Some that come to mind are: guessing games, three-card monty games, slot machine and other gambling games, memory games, etc.

The Arduino Nano and speaker are common. The vibrator is from an old XBox 360 controller.
